# Tied From The Tide
Unity 2D Maze Game. You are a fisher-mouse who needs to bring their ship back to the dock before the Tide comes in to sweep it away! Made for a GameJam with theme Tide/Tied but I missed the due date cause I slept in haha.
Skills: Line Renderer in Unity, 2D Game Unity, C# scripts 

Game can be played here: https://play.unity.com/en/games/bc625d28-96b1-472d-aee6-776d91b97a9f/webgl

## Update 1.0
Issue: Game is NOT responsive and unfortunately looks hideous on level 0 (will need to fix).
